# Trollcode

Xcode getting you down? The beachball making you blue? What you need is ***trollcode***!

1. When Xcode hangs, trollcode displays a trollface to cheer you up.
2. Trollcode records the duration of each hang, and occasionally reports back to our Top Secret Snooping Facility. We'll display statistics of each Xcode tea break on [our site](http://chocolatapp.com/trollcode).

## Installation

Download from [here](http://files.fileability.net/trollcode_0.2.zip). Then just run it and wait (probably not very long).

## License

WTFPL. Because, fuck lawyers.
