# Trollcode

Xcode getting you down? The beachball making you blue? What you need is ***trollcode***!

1. When Xcode hangs, trollcode displays a trollface 
2. Trollface records the duration of each hang, and occasionally reports back to our Top Secret Snooping Facility. We'll display statistics of each Xcode tea break on [our site](http://chocolatapp.com/trollcode).

## Installation

Download from [http://files.fileability.net/Trollcode_0.1.zip](here). Then just run it and wait (probably not very long).

## License

WTFPL. Because, fuck lawyers.
